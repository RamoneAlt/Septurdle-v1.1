# *Septurdle-v1.1*
Septurdle is a project I've been working on for some time now. The goal is to make the correct 7 letter word within 6 tries to win the game! 

Grey = Letter is not in the word;  
Yellow = Letter in word, not in the right spot;  
Green = Correct letter in the correct spot;  

**Pretty simple rules of course, enjoy! :D**
